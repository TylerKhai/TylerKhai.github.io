//FUNCTIONS

/*The two phases to using functions: First we must ___? Next we can execute (or two other words for executing a function?) a function by?
* First we declare and then execute/call
*/

/*What’s the difference between a function’s parameters and arguments PASSED to a function?
* Parameters are placeholders that act as stand-ins for the values that the function will be used on.
*/

/*What’s the syntax for a NAMED function?
* function functionName(parameters) {
   function body
   function body
   return statement
}
*/

//How do we assign a function to a variable?
var bread = function () {};

//Functions can OPTIONALLY take inputs, and OPTIONALLY return a single value. How do we specify inputs, and how do we specify outputs?
// - arguements and return

//Scope: Functions can see and modify variables in parent or global scopes. The inverse is NOT true.

//Closures: Functions form closures around the data they house. If an object returned from the Function and is held in memory somewhere
//(referenced), that closure stays ALIVE, and data can continue to exist in these closures!
